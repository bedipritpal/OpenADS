# Known issues — current

Status as of **v1.8.8** (2026-07-10).

## Open

### SAP ACE wire protocol

OpenADS speaks its own documented wire protocol on `tcp://` / `tls://`.
It is **not** byte-compatible with the proprietary SAP Advantage 11.x/12.x
TCP protocol. Talking to a legacy ADS server as a drop-in client requires
a future `SapWireTransport` layer (`ads://` / `sap://` URIs).

### CDX rollback to SAP ACE (error 7017)

OpenADS **reads** SAP-built CDX files without modification. Once OpenADS
**writes** a CDX (append, reindex, `INDEX ON`, etc.), the file uses
Harbour's DBFCDX layout (magic `RCHB` at offset 0x14). SAP ACE does not
recognize that header and returns **error 7017** (*Corrupt .ADI, .CDX, or
.IDX index*). Rollback is not automatic — back up original `.cdx` files
before migration, or delete and rebuild all tags under SAP after reverting.
See [Migrating from ADS](en/migrating-from-ads/) for the full checklist.

### OEM national collations beyond PL852

Only the Polish CP-852 table (`NTXPL852` / `PL852`) is implemented.
Other `OEM_CHAR_SET` values SAP supports in `adslocal.cfg` (MAZOVIA,
additional NTX* variants, GREEK437, RUSSIAN, …) are recognised but
leave the default at raw byte order. Tracked as
[issue #127](https://github.com/FiveTechSoft/OpenADS/issues/127).

Activation for OEM apps is zero-config since v1.8.9-dev: a table
opened with `usCharType = ADS_OEM` (rddads `AdsSetCharType(ADS_OEM)`)
picks up the default OEM collation from `adslocal.cfg`
(`OEM_CHAR_SET=NTXPL852`, file next to `openace64.dll` or in the
current directory) or from the `OPENADS_OEM_COLLATION` environment
variable (which wins when both are set).
`AdsSetCollation(hConn, ...)` stays available as a per-connection
override. If OEM data was indexed on v1.8.6/v1.8.7 (which built
`UPPER()` keys without CP-852 casing), run `REINDEX` once after
configuring the collation.

The default OEM collation is applied by the in-process engine
(LocalServer). `openads_serverd` remote connections do not yet
propagate the client's char type to the server.

### CDX `INDEX ON` write performance

CDX `REINDEX` and `AdsCreateIndex*` now use the bulk bottom-up B+tree
build (v1.8.0) and, for the key-collection phase, direct driver reads
that preserve the read-ahead cache instead of per-record `goto_record`
(which invalidated the cache on every step). This targets the ~11×
gap reported for local rddads `INDEX ON` vs. SAP ACE on real DBFCDX
workloads (issue #128). Further parity work may be needed for
expression evaluation (e.g. UPPER/VAL on OEM data) and multi-tag
resync overheads. Tracked as [issue #128](https://github.com/FiveTechSoft/OpenADS/issues/128).

### SAP-imported Data Dictionary permissions

For `.add` files created by SAP Data Architect, per-table group
permission levels are encoded in encrypted 8-byte blobs that OpenADS
cannot decode yet. Imported DDs may show full DML for every group
where SAP shows read-only access. Use `pmsys_imported.add` (via
`tools/import_dd`) or grant permissions from OpenADS-native tooling.

### TLS certificate verification

`tls://` verifies peer certificates by default. Self-signed or
private-CA endpoints require either a CA bundle (future
`AdsSetTlsCa` entry point) or the dev-only environment variable
`OPENADS_TLS_INSECURE=1`.

### Server-side TLS termination

Client-side TLS (`tls://` in `ace64.dll`) is implemented via mbedtls.
`openads_serverd` does not terminate TLS natively — front it with
nginx, Caddy, or stunnel. See [TLS deployment](en/tls-deployment/).

### Studio LocalServer auth

LocalServer mode (Studio embedded in `ace64.dll` / `ace32.dll`) has no
HTTP Basic auth. The default bind is `127.0.0.1`; if you set
`OPENADS_STUDIO_HOST=0.0.0.0`, put the console behind a reverse proxy
that handles authentication. Remote Server mode (`openads_serverd`)
supports `--http-user user:password`.

### DDL execution

`ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, and `DROP INDEX` are parsed but
backend execution hooks are not wired yet.

### Load-flaky timing tests quarantined (`[flaky]`)

Seven timing-sensitive cases fail intermittently on loaded/shared CI
runners while passing everywhere else (different victims across
identical runs — the flake signature): the two connection-storm
cases in `abi_remote_create_stress_test.cpp`, `OpenIndex on
exclusive-held bag` (`abi_openindex_create_race_test.cpp`, strict
`6106 vs 7040` order-dependence), `Teardown batching: dirty
flush travels alone under a park` (`network_teardown_batch_test.cpp`,
intermittent SIGSEGV), and — since v1.09.63 — the three MT
contention cases in `abi_mt_contention_test.cpp` that share
`verify_mt` (8-writer key counts at `:165`, walk length at `:193`,
walk order at `:186`; observed failing on the TLS leg and the
release Ubuntu leg, always the remote-server variant, e.g.
`prev=[Charlie]@1 cur=[Alice]@12`). They are tagged `[flaky]`,
excluded from the default and slow `ctest` tiers (still runnable
explicitly, e.g. `openads_unit_tests -tc=*storm*`), and tracked
here until de-flaked properly. They blocked four consecutive
releases via the all-or-nothing gate (v1.09.52–56 era) —
quarantining the suite is what lets releases proceed while the
races are investigated.
OPEN QUESTION (v1.09.64): the `:186` backward key jump happened on
a quiescent post-join tree, which a pure load flake cannot explain
— it smells like a shape-dependent duplicate-ordering issue in the
remote ordered-skip path (this test deliberately stresses
duplicate-key page splits with 10 shared names). If it reproduces
deterministically for a given tree shape it gets a real fix, not
just quarantine; until then the quarantine holds the gate.

## Closed recently

- **Linux/macOS CI and release builds broken (NTXPL852 tests)** — fixed
  v1.8.2: shared `polish_oem_fixture.h`; Clang `-Wstring-concatenation` /
  greedy `\x` escape errors in unit tests.
- **`OrdScope` / `AdsSetScope` on character fields** — fixed v1.8.1:
  unpadded scope strings (Harbour `hb_itemGetCLen`) are now space-padded to
  index `key_length` before comparison — work-order `setScopeTop` /
  `setScopeBottom` + `gotop` on local and remote.
- **NTXPL852 / PL852 OEM collation** — fixed v1.8.0: CDX build, seek,
  insert, and reindex honour the PL852 sort table; `AdsSetCollation`
  accepts `NTXPL852` / `PL852`.
- **CDX `REINDEX` per-record rebuild** — improved v1.8.0: bulk
  `build_bulk()` path for CDX tags.
- **Remote `AdsSetScope` / `OrdScope` ignored** — fixed v1.7.0:
  `GotoTop`/`Skip` now honour scoped key ranges over `tcp://`.
- **Remote `OrdKeyCount()` returns 0** — fixed v1.6.5: new `GetKeyCount`
  wire opcode; xBrowse grids show the correct filtered row count.
- **`AdsGetDate()` crash on remote Date fields** — fixed v1.6.5:
  `RemoteIndex` handles resolve to the parent `RemoteTable` before
  field I/O.
- **Numeric `dbSeek` not-found on aliased CDX tags** — fixed v1.6.x:
  seek path converts raw double keys to the stored `FoxNumeric` /
  ASCII form; alias qualifiers stripped on the read side.
- **Conditional index re-create stale order** — fixed v1.6.x:
  in-place `CREATE INDEX` on an open bag rebinds expression, FOR,
  and the active order (`abi_cond_refilter_no_close_test`).
- **WSL2 / Linux `-Werror=conversion` build failures** — fixed:
  narrowing casts and linkage issues in `ace_exports.cpp`; Linux CI
  green on v1.7.0.
- **Remote FiveWin / TDataBase field I/O** — fixed v1.6.4: Date columns,
  ordinal-as-pointer idiom, unlocked-write `EG_UNLOCKED` parity.
- **Remote xBrowse index navigation** — fixed v1.6.3: `AdsKeyNo`,
  bookmark `GotoRecord` sync, `AdsAtBOF` at first key.
- **VFP header 0x32 (autoinc + nullable)** — fixed v1.5.1.
- **Plus SQLite / MSSQL read-only** — fixed v1.5.1: navigational write.
- **Remote `AdsSetRelation` / `AdsSetRecord` / `AdsCustomizeAOF`** —
  fixed v1.5.1 (Fase 2).

See `CHANGELOG.md` for the full per-release breakdown.

## Safe listener defaults (security hardening)

`openads_serverd` now binds `127.0.0.1` by default, including the setup
wizard. Explicit `host` values in existing INI files still override this default. Existing clients and wire payloads are unchanged.
A non-loopback bind without `auth_user` is rejected unless the operator
explicitly selects `--allow_anonymous` (`allow_anonymous=true` in INI).
The same gate applies to an enabled Studio listener without `http_user`.
All non-loopback TCP listeners emit a cleartext warning, including those
with authentication. **This is exposure mitigation, not native TLS**:
use the documented TLS proxy, and firewall its cleartext backend so only
the proxy can reach it. Do not expose TCP credentials to untrusted networks.
Credential hardening: new DD passwords use salted PBKDF2-SHA256. Existing
plaintext password entries are verified in constant time and migrated after
successful named login; unknown or invalid users are never migrated. Password
property 1101 is now write-only through AdsDDGetUserProperty. This deliberately
breaks applications that read passwords back. Named logins now require a valid
password even if LOG_IN_REQUIRED is disabled, preventing AdsSys impersonation.
Legacy anonymous local dictionary setup still works; it is not a network grant.

Security hardening limits: network Mutex Lock is now fail-fast on contention,
not an infinite wait for timeout=0. Applications must retry. Network idle
sessions expire after 5 minutes; handshake and incomplete frames after 30
seconds. Maximum 256 tables/cursors and 64 created mutexes per connection.

Explicit and AppendBlank record locks are capped at 4096 per session; SQL-generated append locks remain under review.
